# Haikuverse Public Gallery ðŸ¦‘

---
## 1. Introduction

The Haikuverse Public Gallery is a lightweight, read-only web portal designed to serve as the public, discoverable "front door" to the Haikuverse ecosystem while also providing a personalized hub for authenticated members.

Built with **Next.js**, it is deployed on **Firebase Hosting** using the `frameworksBackend` feature, which intelligently runs all server-side logic (API Routes, SSR) on a scalable **Google Cloud Run** service. It strategically employs a **hybrid rendering model**:
* **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Used for core SEO pages like Poet Portfolios and Constellation Galleries, ensuring maximum performance and discoverability.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Dynamic:** Used for API routes and individual Star detail pages.
* **Static Rendering:** Used for client-side pages like the Homepage and Dashboard.

This mission-critical app attracts new users organically and offers a convenient, high-performance web touchpoint for the existing community.

### Key Features:

* **Blazing Fast & SEO-Optimized:** Leverages **Next.js**'s hybrid rendering, using **SSG** for core content (`/poet/[nickname]`, `/constellation/[name]`) to ensure fast load times and search engine visibility.
* **Dynamic Poet Portfolios:** Every poet gets a unique, shareable, statically-generated page that automatically showcases their bio, high-resolution avatar, owned constellations, and contributions to other constellations.
* **Immersive Constellation Galleries:** Each constellation has its own dedicated, statically-generated page featuring its fable, lore image, and a gallery of all the stars within it.
* **Detailed Star Experience:** A server-rendered star page showcases each creation with a high-resolution, optimized image slideshow timed to the cadence of the audio preview and a display for community like counts.
* **Clear User Acquisition Funnel:** A prominent call-to-action on the main page directs new visitors to the Google Play Store, creating a direct path from discovery to download.
* **Interactive Homepage Hub:** Features a dynamic **Zeitgeist Map** highlighting trending community themes and a **Poet Search** bar for easy discovery.
* **Secure User Authentication:** Supports secure sign-in via **Google Sign-In (GSI)**, managed globally with React Context. The production environment is secured by authorizing the live domain in both the **GCP OAuth Client ID** and the **reCAPTCHA Enterprise key** settings.
* **Personalized Member Dashboard:** Logged-in users access a dashboard that calls serverless API routes to display their Haikuverse **nickname** and real-time lists of poets they **follow** and who **follow them**.
* **Gated Creator Access:** Provides a convenient link to the **Haikuverse Web Creator** for authenticated users.
* **Robust & Secure Backend:**
    * Employs a server-only **Firebase Admin SDK**, which is initialized as a **uniquely named app** (`haikuverse-gallery-admin`) to prevent conflicts within the Next.js server environment.
    * All server-side credentials (`PROJECT_ID`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`) are securely injected into the **Google Cloud Run** environment at deploy time using **Google Secret Manager**, configured via `firebase.json`.
    * All API routes (`/api/*`) are refactored to import and use the single, centralized `auth` and `db` instances, ensuring consistent, authenticated access to Firebase services.
* **Optimized for Production:**
    * The deployed Cloud Run service is configured with **1GiB of memory** in `firebase.json` to handle Next.js server-side rendering loads without crashing.
    * Uses the Next.js `<Image>` component with correctly configured `remotePatterns` (for `storage.googleapis.com` and `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`) and `sizes` props (e.g., `sizes="16rem"` for avatars) to ensure high-resolution, optimized images are served.
    * Codebase is updated to be compatible with **Next.js 15**'s asynchronous `params` handling, using `await params` in `async` components and direct prop access in `React.use` components.

## 3. Core Architecture & Services

The Haikuverse Public Gallery is built on a modern, SEO-first technology stack, leveraging the **Next.js** framework and deploying to **Firebase Hosting**. The `frameworksBackend` feature is enabled, which deploys all server-side logic (API Routes, SSR) to a scalable **Google Cloud Run** service. The table below provides a high-level overview of the key technologies employed.

| Layer                | Technology / Service                             | Purpose                                       |

| **Hosting**          | Firebase Hosting                                 | Serves static assets, routes backend requests |

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the application's core components.

### 3.1 Next.js App Router (`src/app/`)

The application is built using the **Next.js App Router**, which uses a file-based routing system. Folders within the `src/app/` directory define the URL structure of the site.

* **Static Routes:** The root homepage is defined by `src/app/page.tsx`.
* **Dynamic Routes:** Pages for individual poets and constellations are created using folders with square brackets, such as `src/app/poet/[nickname]/page.tsx`.
* **Layouts:** The root layout at `src/app/layout.tsx` defines the shell `<html>` and `<body>` tags that wrap every page, ensuring a consistent base structure and styling.
* **Client Routes:** The user dashboard (`/dashboard`) is implemented as a client component, dynamically rendering based on authentication state.
* **API Routes:** Backend logic accessible to the client is defined in `/api/` folders (e.g.,`/api/profile/nickname/route.ts`). These handle secure data fetching for interactive components.

### 3.2 Hybrid Rendering Strategy

The gallery employs a hybrid rendering approach, optimized for SEO, performance, and interactivity.

* **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Core discovery pages like poet portfolios (`/poet/[nickname]`) and constellation galleries (`/constellation/[name]`) use `generateStaticParams`. This pre-renders static HTML at build time using the **Firebase Admin SDK** for secure data fetching, ensuring fast initial loads and excellent SEO.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Individual star detail pages (`/star/[id]`) are rendered on-demand (dynamic) to ensure the latest like counts and details are always shown.
* **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Pages requiring user interaction and browser-side state (like the Homepage and Dashboard) are designated as Client Components using the **`"use client";`** directive.
* **API Routes:** Serverless functions co-located with the app (`/api/*`) act as a secure backend gateway for Client Components.

### 3.3 Client Components & State Management (`"use client";`)

Client Components handle user interaction, browser-specific APIs, and state management within the user's browser.

* **Interactivity & Data Fetching:** Components like the `PoetSearch` on the homepage, the `DashboardPage`, and the site `Header` are Client Components. They use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage local UI state and fetch dynamic data.
* **Authentication State:** A global **`AuthContext`** (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) provides application-wide access to the current user's authentication state (`user`, `loading`) via the `useAuth` hook.
* **Client-Side Firebase:** The **Firebase Client SDK** (`src/lib/firebaseClient.ts`) is initialized for client-side operations:
    * **Firebase Auth:** Manages the sign-in state.
    * **Firebase App Check:** Secures client-side requests using reCAPTCHA Enterprise.
* **Google Sign-In (GSI):** GSI is integrated via `gsiHelper.ts`. For production, this required authorizing the deployed domain (`haikuverse-gallery.web.app`) in both the **GCP OAuth Client ID's** "Authorized JavaScript origins" and the **reCAPTCHA Enterprise key's** "Domains" list.
* **API Interaction:** Client Components fetch data securely by calling the Next.js **API Routes** using `fetch` within `useEffect` hooks, passing the user's Firebase ID token for authorization.

### 3.4 Styling with CSS Modules

The gallery's styling is implemented using **CSS Modules**, a system that scopes CSS locally to each component. This approach was chosen to ensure style encapsulation and prevent class name conflicts.

* **Scoped by Default:** Each page or component has its own `*.module.css` file (e.g., `PoetPage.module.css`). The build process automatically generates unique class names, guaranteeing that styles from one component cannot accidentally affect another.
* **Maintainability:** This architecture creates a clean separation between a component's structure (in the `.tsx` file) and its appearance (in the `.module.css` file), making the codebase easier to read and maintain.

### 3.5 Backend Integration & Security

This layer manages the connection to backend services and enforces security, running entirely within the **Google Cloud Run** environment on the server.

* **Centralized Admin SDK (`src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts`):** This is the core of the backend. It initializes the **Firebase Admin SDK** as a **uniquely named app** (`haikuverse-gallery-admin`) to prevent initialization conflicts within the Next.js server environment. It exports the initialized `db` (Firestore) and `auth` (Auth) instances for use across the server.
* **Secure Credentials:** In production, server-side credentials (`PROJECT_ID`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`) are **injected securely from Google Secret Manager** into the Cloud Run environment at deploy time. This is configured in `firebase.json` using the `secretEnvironmentVariables` block.
* **API Routes (`src/app/api/`):** All API routes have been refactored to **import the centralized `db` and `auth` instances** from `firebaseAdmin.ts`. This ensures they all use the single, correctly authenticated Admin SDK instance.
* **Data Fetching Service (`src/lib/firebaseService.ts`):** Centralizes reusable data-fetching functions (e.g., `getAllPoets`, `getStarById`) used by Server Components during SSG.

### 3.6 Production Deployment Configuration

Several critical configurations were required to make the production deployment stable:

* **Cloud Run Memory:** The `firebase.json` file is configured to provision the `frameworksBackend` service with **1GiB of memory** to prevent out-of-memory crashes during Next.js server-side rendering.
* **Next.js Image Optimization:** The `next.config.mjs` file includes `remotePatterns` for both `storage.googleapis.com` (for Signed URLs like avatars) and `firebasestorage.googleapis.com` (for Firebase token URLs like generated images). `sizes` props (e.g., `sizes="16rem"`) are used in components like `PoetPage` to ensure high-resolution images are fetched.
* **Build Error Workaround:** The `next.config.mjs` file currently uses `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` and `eslint: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }`. This is a **temporary hack** to bypass a persistent `PageProps` type error and ESLint errors that were blocking deployment. This must be addressed for a clean production build (see `BACKLOG.md`).

## 4. Security, Testing, and Setup

This section details the gallery's security model, outlines the testing strategy, and provides a clear guide for setting up the development and production environments.

### 4.1 Multi-Layered Security Model

The gallery employs a multi-layered security approach, combining server-side safeguards with client-side verification.

* **Server-Side Security (Firebase Admin SDK):**
    * The entire Next.js server (SSG, SSR, API Routes) runs in a **Google Cloud Run** container managed by Firebase Hosting.
    * A **centralized Firebase Admin SDK** (`src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts`) is initialized as a **uniquely named app** (`haikuverse-gallery-admin`) to prevent conflicts.
    * This Admin SDK is used by all server-side code (SSG, API Routes) for data fetching and token verification.
    * **In Production:** Credentials (`PROJECT_ID`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`) are securely injected into the Cloud Run environment from **Google Secret Manager** at deploy time, as configured in `firebase.json`.
    * **In Development:** Credentials are read from local `.env.local` variables.

* **Client-Side Security (Client SDK & App Check):**
    * User authentication is handled client-side via the **Firebase Authentication Client SDK** and **Google Sign-In (GSI)**.
    * **Firebase App Check** (with reCAPTCHA Enterprise) is integrated to verify that requests originate from a legitimate instance of the gallery website.
    * **Production GSI/App Check:** This requires authorizing the production URL (`https://haikuverse-gallery.web.app`) in two places:
        1.  The **GCP OAuth Client ID's** "Authorized JavaScript origins".
        2.  The **reCAPTCHA Enterprise Key's** "Domains" list.
    * **Local GSI/App Check:** This requires setting the `self.FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` in the browser console.

* **Secure Cloud Function Interaction:**
    * Next.js API Routes act as a secure proxy to the original Haikuverse v1 Cloud Functions (`getFollowingDetails`, `getFollowersDetails`).
    * The API Route verifies the client's ID token using the named Admin app (`auth.verifyIdToken()`), then makes a server-to-server `fetch` call to the Cloud Function URL, forwarding the ID token for the v1 function to perform its own verification.

### 4.2 Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for ensuring the gallery is robust, performant, and maintainable. The plan includes:

* **Unit Testing:** The service layer functions in `src/lib/firebaseService.ts` will be unit-tested using a framework like **Jest**. This involves mocking the Firebase Admin SDK to verify that our data-fetching functions correctly handle various database responses without making actual database calls.
* **Component Testing:** Interactive Client Components, such as the `StarSlideshow` and `StarDetailClient`, will be tested with **React Testing Library**. These tests will simulate user interactions (like clicking a play button) and assert that the component's state and appearance update as expected.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** A tool like **Cypress** or **Playwright** will be used to run automated tests on the complete, running application. These tests will simulate a full user journeyâ€”navigating from the homepage to a poet page, then to a constellation, and finally to a starâ€”verifying that all pages load correctly and links work as intended.
* **Context Testing:** The `AuthContext` provider will be tested to ensure it correctly reflects user login/logout states and provides the user object as expected.
* **API Route Testing:** Next.js API Routes will be tested, potentially using tools like `next-test-api-route-handler` or similar, mocking Firebase Admin functions (`verifyIdToken`, Firestore reads) and fetch calls to Cloud Functions.

### 4.3 Setup and Configuration

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Node.js** (v20+ recommended)
* **Visual Studio Code** or another code editor
* Access to the Haikuverse Firebase project
* Google Cloud Project with Billing enabled
* Enabled Firebase Services: Authentication (Google Sign-In), Firestore, App Check (Web provider)
* Enabled Google Cloud APIs: reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Secret Manager, Cloud Run

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chesterwizzle/haikuverse_gallery.git](https://github.com/chesterwizzle/haikuverse_gallery.git)
    cd haikuverse_gallery
```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
    npm install
```

3.  **Configure Local Environment Variables (`.env.local`):**
    * In the project root, create a file named `.env.local` (this file is git-ignored).
    * **Server-Side Variables (Firebase Admin SDK):**
        * Generate a new **service account JSON key** from Google Cloud (IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Your Admin SDK Account > Keys > Add Key).
        * Copy the values into the `.env.local` file. **IMPORTANT:** The `PRIVATE_KEY` value must be a single-line string with `\n` characters replacing the newlines.
```bash
        # Server-Side (Admin SDK)
        PROJECT_ID="haiku-bot-advanced"
        CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@haiku-bot-advanced.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
        PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvg...Your...Key...Here...\n...More...Key...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```
    * **Server-Side Variables (Cloud Function URLs):**
```bash
        GET_FOLLOWING_DETAILS_URL="[https://us-central1-haiku-bot-advanced.cloudfunctions.net/getFollowingDetails](https://us-central1-haiku-bot-advanced.cloudfunctions.net/getFollowingDetails)"
        GET_FOLLOWERS_DETAILS_URL="[https://us-central1-haiku-bot-advanced.cloudfunctions.net/getFollowersDetails](https://us-central1-haiku-bot-advanced.cloudfunctions.net/getFollowersDetails)"
```
    * **Client-Side Variables (Firebase Client SDK & App Check):**
        * Get these values from your **Firebase Project Settings > Your Web App** ("Haikuverse Gallery (web)").
        * Get the **reCAPTCHA Site Key** from the **Google Cloud Console > reCAPTCHA Enterprise**.
```bash
        # Client-Side (MUST start with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="haiku-bot-advanced.firebaseapp.com"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="haiku-bot-advanced"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="haiku-bot-advanced.firebasestorage.app"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:...:web:..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY="6Le0Lowr...YourSiteKey..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="9450815...apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
```bash
    npm run dev
```
    The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Localhost GSI/App Check Setup:**
    * Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
    * Open the Developer Console (F12).
    * Run `self.FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN = true;` and refresh the page.
    * Look for the log `App Check debug token: '...'`. Copy the token string.
    * Run `self.FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";` in the console.
    * Refresh again. Google Sign-In should now work on localhost.

### 4.4 Production Deployment (Firebase Hosting)

Deploying to production requires additional one-time setup:

1.  **Configure Build Workarounds (Temporary):**
    * In `next.config.mjs`, add the following blocks to ignore the persistent TypeScript and ESLint errors during the build (see `BACKLOG.md` to fix these):
```javascript
        typescript: {
          ignoreBuildErrors: true,
        },
        eslint: {
          ignoreBuildErrors: true,
        },
```

2.  **Configure Server Secrets (Google Secret Manager):**
    * Go to **Google Cloud Console > Security > Secret Manager**.
    * Create three secrets:
        1.  `GALLERY_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Value = `haiku-bot-advanced`
        2.  `GALLERY_FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`: Value = `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@...iam.gserviceaccount.com`
        3.  `GALLERY_FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: **CRITICAL:** Paste the **raw, multi-line** private key value directly from the **downloaded service account JSON file** (do *not* use the single-line string from `.env.local`).

3.  **Configure Cloud Run Service:**
    * Go to **Google Cloud Console > Cloud Run** and find the `ssrhaikuversegallery` service.
    * Click on the **"Revisions"** tab, select the latest revision, and go to its **"Security"** tab.
    * Copy the **Service account** email (e.g., `94508156564-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`).
    * Go back to **Secret Manager**. For each of the three secrets created, go to **"Permissions"**, click **"+ Grant Access"**, paste the service account email as the principal, and assign the role **"Secret Manager Secret Accessor"**.

4.  **Configure `firebase.json`:**
    * Update your `firebase.json` file to increase memory and link the secrets:
```json
        {
          "target": "gallery",
          "source": ".",
          "ignore": [...],
          "frameworksBackend": {

5.  **Configure GSI & App Check Domains:**
    * **GCP OAuth Client ID:** Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**. Edit your "Web client" OAuth ID. Under **"Authorized JavaScript origins"**, add `https://haikuverse-gallery.web.app`.
    * **reCAPTCHA Enterprise:** Go to **Security > reCAPTCHA Enterprise**. Edit your key. Under **"Domains"**, add `haikuverse-gallery.web.app`.
    * **Firebase App Check:** Go to **Firebase Console > App Check > Apps**. Find "Haikuverse Gallery (web)" and "Register" it, providing your reCAPTCHA site key.

6.  **Deploy:**
```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting:gallery
```

## 5. Design Philosophy & Production Architecture

The Haikuverse Public Gallery embodies a dual mission, extending the core application's **"Designed for Humans"** philosophy. It serves as both a public, discoverable archive optimized for SEO and a personalized web portal for authenticated members. Architectural decisions balance the need for organic user acquisition via search engines with providing a seamless, low-friction authenticated experience for the existing community.

### 5.1 Hybrid Architecture: Balancing SSG, SSR, and Client Interactivity

A key architectural choice was building the gallery with **Next.js** and deploying it to **Firebase Hosting** with the `frameworksBackend` feature. This runs the entire Next.js application (including server-side logic) on a **Google Cloud Run** service, allowing for a sophisticated hybrid rendering model. Core discovery pages like poet portfolios (`/poet/[nickname]`) and constellation galleries (`/constellation/[name]`) use **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. This pre-renders static HTML at build time, providing semantic content that is perfectly indexable by search engines and loads instantly. Individual star pages (`/star/[id]`) are rendered on-demand (dynamic) to ensure data like like counts is always fresh, while pages requiring user interaction (like the Homepage and Dashboard) are rendered as Client Components using **`"use client";`** to provide a fast, app-like interactive experience.

### 5.2 A Secure & Resilient Backend Infrastructure

Getting the gallery to run reliably in a production environment required a robust backend configuration to handle authentication, credentials, and resource management. The core of the backend is a centralized **Firebase Admin SDK** (`src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts`), which is initialized as a **uniquely named app** (`haikuverse-gallery-admin`) to prevent initialization conflicts within the Next.js server environment. All API routes were refactored to import and use the single, correctly initialized `auth` and `db` instances from this file, fixing all "default Firebase app does not exist" 500 errors. In production, server-side credentials (`PROJECT_ID`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`) are securely injected into the Cloud Run environment from **Google Secret Manager**, as configured in `firebase.json`. This configuration also provisions the service with **`"memory": "1GiB"`** to ensure the Next.js server has enough resources to handle SSR and image optimization without crashing.

### 5.3 Robust Authentication (GSI & App Check)

Integrating Google Sign-In on a custom domain with App Check required solving a complex chain of security errors. The final, secure solution required authorizing the production URL (`https://haikuverse-gallery.web.app`) in three distinct places: first, in the **Firebase Console** by registering the reCAPTCHA key to the web app; second, in the **GCP OAuth Client ID's** "Authorized JavaScript origins" (to fix `origin_mismatch`); and third, in the **reCAPTCHA Enterprise Key's** "Domains" list (to fix `appCheck/recaptcha-error`). This multi-pronged configuration ensures both Google's sign-in service and Firebase's App Check service recognize the deployed domain as legitimate.

### 5.4 Performance & Optimization

The site uses the Next.js `<Image>` component for all content, with `remotePatterns` configured for both `storage.googleapis.com` (for Signed URL avatars) and `firebasestorage.googleapis.com` (for Firebase token-based images). Low-resolution, pixelated avatars on poet pages were fixed by adding a `sizes="16rem"` prop to the avatar's `<Image>` component, correctly informing Next.js to fetch a high-quality image that matches the CSS container. As a temporary measure to unblock deployment, the `next.config.mjs` file currently uses `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` and `eslint: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` to bypass a persistent TypeScript build error and several ESLint warnings. These issues do not affect performance and are tracked in the `BACKLOG.md` for a future permanent fix.

### 5.5 Design Principles (Maintainability & User Experience)

The styling architecture is built on **CSS Modules** to guarantee stability. Each component or page is paired with its own `*.module.css` file, generating unique class names that make it impossible for styles to leak and break other components. All database query logic is consolidated into a dedicated **service layer** (`/lib/firebaseService.ts`), allowing UI components to remain clean and making database logic easy to maintain. This design allows the Public Gallery to serve its dual role: for the public, it's a fast, read-only "showroom" designed for SEO and discovery. For authenticated members, it transforms into a personalized web portal, with the **Dashboard** providing a familiar hub and quick access to their community and creator tools.
