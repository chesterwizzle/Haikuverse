## Project Overview

Haikuverse is a creative ecosystem built on a **"Designed for Humans"** philosophy, empowering users to co-create techno-poetic art. It combines powerful generative AI with a non-toxic community by design, allowing users to augment their artistry rather than replace it.

The ecosystem consists of two primary components:

1.  **The Haikuverse Application (Flutter):** The core multi-sensory experience. This Flutter app (for Android and web) is where users co-create with AI partners (**Gemini**, **Imagen**, and **Text-to-Speech**). They can publish their work and explore the community through a unique, procedurally generated 2D "constellation" graph.
2.  **The Public Gallery (Next.js):** A dual-purpose platform serving as both the ecosystem's SEO-optimized "front door" and its **Print-on-Demand** E-Commerce Engine. This Next.js web portal leverages **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** to deliver lightning-fast, indexable portfolios for public discovery, while offering authenticated creators a secure Print Studio to transform their digital works into physical artifacts.

## Detailed Documentation

This repository contains the detailed technical documentation for the entire Haikuverse ecosystem, split into its core components.

### 1. The Haikuverse Application (Flutter)

* **[View Full Technical Documentation: Haikuverse.md](./Haikuverse.md)**

A comprehensive deep-dive into the main **Flutter application**. This document details the complete architecture, from the client-side state management and procedural graph generation to the complex serverless backend on Google Cloud (Functions, Vertex AI, Vector Search) and the non-toxic community features.

### 2. The Haikuverse Public Gallery (Next.js)

* **[View Full Technical Documentation: Haikuverse Public Gallery.md](./Haikuverse%20Public%20Gallery.md)**

The official documentation for the **public-facing Next.js web portal**. This file explains the hybrid rendering model (ISR, SSG, and SSR) used for SEO, the server-side architecture (Cloud Run, Admin SDK, Secret Manager), and the secure authentication flow for the member dashboard.
